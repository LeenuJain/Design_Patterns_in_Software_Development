# üîπ Decorator Pattern

## üîπ What is it?

The **Decorator Pattern** allows you to add **new behavior or responsibilities** to objects at **runtime**, without modifying their existing code.

> It‚Äôs like adding layers ‚Äî or toppings ‚Äî to something without changing the original.

## üîπ Real-World Analogy: Ice Cream Shop

Imagine you buy a basic scoop of ice cream üç®  
Now you can add:

- üîπ Chocolate syrup  
- üîπ Strawberries  
- üîπ Nuts  

Each topping **decorates** the ice cream, adding new features ‚Äî but the original scoop stays **unchanged underneath**.

That‚Äôs exactly how the **Decorator Pattern** works.

---

## üîπ Key Idea

Instead of **modifying** a class, we **wrap** it with other classes that add functionality.

- These **wrappers** implement the **same interface** as the original object.
- You can add **multiple layers** dynamically and flexibly.

## üêç Python Code Example: Car Wash Services

Let‚Äôs say you have a **basic car wash service**, and you can decorate it with:

-  Wax coating  
-  Interior cleaning  
-  Tire polishing  

```python
# Base Interface
class CarService:
    def get_description(self):
        pass

    def get_cost(self):
        pass

# Concrete Component (basic wash)
class BasicWash(CarService):
    def get_description(self):
        return "Basic Car Wash"

    def get_cost(self):
        return 300

# Decorators
class ServiceDecorator(CarService):
    def __init__(self, service: CarService):
        self.service = service

class WaxCoating(ServiceDecorator):
    def get_description(self):
        return self.service.get_description() + ", Wax Coating"

    def get_cost(self):
        return self.service.get_cost() + 150

class InteriorCleaning(ServiceDecorator):
    def get_description(self):
        return self.service.get_description() + ", Interior Cleaning"

    def get_cost(self):
        return self.service.get_cost() + 200

# Usage
# Base service
service = BasicWash()

# Add wax coating
service = WaxCoating(service)

# Add interior cleaning
service = InteriorCleaning(service)

print("Service:", service.get_description())
print("Total Cost: ‚Çπ", service.get_cost())
```

**Output**
```python
Service: Basic Car Wash, Wax Coating, Interior Cleaning
Total Cost: ‚Çπ 650
```

**Summary**

| Concept              | Role                          |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Component            | CarService                    |
| Concrete Component   | BasicWash                     |
| Decorators           | WaxCoating, InteriorCleaning  |
| Goal                 | Add functionality without changing existing code |

## üîπ Example 2: Online Shopping ‚Äî Gift Wrap / Delivery Options

### Scenario

You buy a product online.  
You can:

- Add gift wrap  
- Add fast delivery  
- Add personalized message  

Each of these is a **decorator** that wraps the original product without changing the base product.

---

### Python Code

```python
product = Product("Book", 500)
gifted = GiftWrap(product)
fast = ExpressDelivery(gifted)
```

**You can now:**
```python
print(f"Description: {fast.get_description()}")
print(f"Total Cost: ‚Çπ{fast.get_cost()}")
```

# üîπ Python Decorator vs Decorator Pattern

The term **"decorator"** in Python can refer to **two different concepts**:

#### üîπ 1. Design Pattern: Decorator Pattern

- The one you're learning now ‚Äî a **Structural Design Pattern**
- It‚Äôs **language-agnostic** (used in Java, C++, etc.)
- It involves **wrapping objects** at runtime to **add behavior**

#### üîπ 2. Python‚Äôs `@decorator` Syntax

- This is **Python-specific syntax sugar**
- Used to **wrap functions or methods** to add behavior (like logging, timing, validation)
- Looks like this:

```python
@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")
```

---

## üîπ Are They Related?

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî in concept, they‚Äôre **similar**:

-  Both **wrap something** (object or function)
-  Both **add new behavior** without changing the original code

But they are used in **different ways**:

### üîπ Comparison Table

| **Feature**      | **Design Pattern Decorator**      | **Python `@decorator`**                      |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Used On             | Objects / Classes                     | Functions / Methods                             |
| Purpose             | Add behavior at **runtime**           | Add behavior at **definition time**             |
| Syntax              | Manually wrapping classes             | `@decorator` syntax                             |
| Common Use          | Car wash, GUI elements, I/O streams   | Logging, authentication, caching                |

---

### üîπ Can We Use Python‚Äôs `@decorator` for the Decorator Pattern?

**Not directly,** Because:

- Python decorators (`@`) work on **functions or methods** ‚Äî not on objects
- But if your goal is to **decorate behavior**, Python decorators can **simulate similar behavior** ‚Äî at the **function level**

---

## üîπ Final Takeaway

- Use Python decorators (`@`) when you're decorating functions.
- Use the Decorator Design Pattern when you're decorating objects/classes.
- They‚Äôre conceptually similar, but technically different tools.

# üîπ Decorator vs Adapter

| Feature             | Decorator Pattern                          | Adapter Pattern                                         |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Goal                | Add new behavior to an object               | Convert an interface so two classes can work together   |
| Focus               | Behavior extension                          | Interface compatibility                                 |
| Structure           | Many decorators can be stacked (layered)    | One-time adapter between incompatible systems           |
| Example             | Add wax & polish to a car wash              | Convert `get_coordinates()` ‚Üí `get_lat_lon()`           |
| Same Interface?     | Yes (to extend behavior)                    | Yes (to match expected format)                          |
| Modifies Behavior?  | Yes (adds features like logging, new logic) | No (just adapts method calls/data structure)            |

---

Looking at the above python example 
```python
service = WaxCoating(BasicWash())
```
**Is It a Decorator or an Adapter?**
Looks like Adapter, right?

But ask yourself:
**‚ùì Am I translating `BasicWash` into a compatible format for `WaxCoating`?**  
Or am I just **adding more features** (like extra service charges or description)?

‚úÖ In this case, you‚Äôre adding features ‚Äî `WaxCoating` is **not expecting a different interface** ‚Äî it's just **decorating an existing one**.
So it‚Äôs a **Decorator**, not an Adapter.

---

## üîπ Key Trick to Distinguish

- If you're making two classes work together **because their interfaces don‚Äôt match** ‚Üí **Adapter**
- If you're **enhancing or extending an object‚Äôs behavior without changing it** ‚Üí **Decorator**
