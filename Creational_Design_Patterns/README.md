# ðŸ§± What are Creational Design Patterns?

Creational design patterns deal with **object creation mechanisms**, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

They help:

- Hide the **creation logic**
- Increase **flexibility** and **reuse**
- Avoid **tight coupling** between classes and the objects they create

## ðŸ§© Types of Creational Design Patterns

There are **five main types**:

| Pattern             | Purpose                                                                 | Example Use Case                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **1. Singleton**     | Ensures a class has only one instance, and provides global access to it | Database connection, logger                |
| **2. Factory Method**| Lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate                       | GUI buttons for different OS               |
| **3. Abstract Factory** | Creates families of related objects without specifying concrete classes | UI themes, cross-platform UI kits          |
| **4. Builder**        | Separates complex object construction from its representation           | Building a house or creating an HTML page  |
| **5. Prototype**      | Creates new objects by copying an existing object (clone)               | Copying game characters, settings profiles |
