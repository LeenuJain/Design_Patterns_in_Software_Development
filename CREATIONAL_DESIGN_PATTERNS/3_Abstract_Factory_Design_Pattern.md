# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## ðŸ”¹ What is the Abstract Factory Design Pattern?

The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an **interface for creating families of related or dependent objects** without specifying their concrete classes. It's like a factory of factories!

## ðŸ”¹ Real-World Analogy
Think of a furniture manufacturer that makes both modern and vintage furniture:
- They produce chairs, tables, and sofas (product families)
- Each piece comes in modern or vintage style (variants)
- You want complete sets in the same style (related objects)

## ðŸ”¹ Why Use Singleton?

- When your system needs to be independent of how its products are created
- When you need to create families of related products that should be used together
- When you want to provide a class library of products, revealing only their interfaces
- When you need to enforce constraints on product combinations

## ðŸ”¹ Real-World Examples
- UI Toolkits: Creating UI elements for different operating systems
- Database Access: Creating connection objects for different database systems
- Vehicle Manufacturing: Creating parts for different vehicle models
- Cross-Platform Applications: Creating platform-specific components

## ðŸ”¹ Abstract Factory vs. Factory Method
- Factory Method: Creates a single product
- Abstract Factory: Creates entire families of related products
